A nextjs project with bun to run playwright test commands from the browser and visualize the commands in the embedded browser.

## Getting Started

### üìã Requirements
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- Package manager: bun, npm, or yarn
- Docker (version 20.10 or higher)

### Quick Start
**Note: Docker must be running for the quick start to work.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suyash5053/playwright-browser-runner.git && cd playwright-browser-runner && docker compose up --build
```

### Installation

Installation will take time for the first time as two docker images are built and the next time it will be faster. **Note: Docker must be running for the installation to work.**

### üöÄ Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suyash5053/playwright-browser-runner.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd playwright-browser-runner
```

3. Build the Docker image:
